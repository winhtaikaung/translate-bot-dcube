# bot-backend

Code is based on snippets provided [here](https://medium.com/swlh/serverless-super-simple-api-development-with-go-terraform-and-aws-lambda-cc2dd6c531cb) with some amendments:

## Deploying via Makefile and Terraform

Refer to [Makefile](./Makefile) for task details.

### 1. Build backend app binary

`make build`

### 2. Run `terraform plan`

Preview actions Terraform will perform on infrastructure based on changes made to app binary and terraform config.

`make plan`

### 3. Run `terraform apply`

Apply changes to infrastructure based on changes shown in `make plan`

`make apply`

### Extras: `make dev`

Runs golang app in development mode, and live reloads when changes are detected.

## Makefile

1. `terraform init|plan|apply|destroy infra` no longer works. To execute terraform commands using configuration in another folder, use `terraform -chdir=infra init|plan|apply|destroy`.
2. `go build` command used in `build` target is simplified to `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -v -a -o build/bin/app .`. Build produced tested to be working fine in AWS Lambda.
3. Modified terraform commands to take in vars from .tfvars file.

## Modifying bot logic

### 1. Adding new commands

1. Open `commands/commands.go` file, locate `GetCommands()` function.
2. Add new item to `mapping`.
3. All `CommandFunc` type functions should be stored in `commands` package.

Used logic for setting up routes and detecting AWS Lambda environment via env var, and allowing endpoints to be run locally. However usage of `apex/gateway` library is outdated, used next link instead.
